# Phoenix Elm Boilerplate

This is a Phoenix Elm boilerplate with both technologies working beautifully together. This is a very simple boilerplate with no routing/sockets setup. This project used create-elm-app for the Elm component.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser where you should also see your Elm app.
